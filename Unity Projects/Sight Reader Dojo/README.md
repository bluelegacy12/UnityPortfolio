# Sight Reader Dojo

This is a simple tool intended to help high school choir students practice their sight reading skills. 
It follows the All-State audition process and randomly selects an exercise from previous auditions. 
It even allows you to record your attempt and play it back. You can also listen to the correct pitches 
from a pre-recorded track.

The recording will only work if you have a proper microphone setup and it will use the default microphone settings.

Use the .zip file for the desktop version (just extract the zip file and click the .exe file within it) 
and for androids, the .apk file can be downloaded directly to your android device.
