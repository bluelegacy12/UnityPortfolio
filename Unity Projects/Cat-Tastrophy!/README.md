# Cat-Tastrophy

This is my first 3D game! It's a game of cat and mouse made with the Unity engine.
It supports mouse and keyboard, and controller inputs. The android version supports touch controls and controller if one is connected.

The browser based version can be found here: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-268380 
(NOTE: The arrow keys move North, South, East, West instead of relative to the camera - use WASD for movement and mouse for camera or use a controller)

Instructions and controls can be found in game.

Use the .zip file for the desktop version (just extract the zip file and click the .exe file within it) 
and for androids, the .apk file can be downloaded directly to your android device.
